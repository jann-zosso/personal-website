            <b>Explore the Memory of Gravity</b> that aims at a better
            understanding of the nature of spacetime and providing the

            From Curved Spacetime to Gravitational Waves

            One of the most intriguing insights of modern physics is the
            knowledge that space is not just a rigid container for events to
            happen in and matter to sit inside. A piece of rock flying through
            space (like the mood), will generally not follow a straight line,
            because space itself is curved by the presence of heavy compact
            matter (like the earth). The through in space created by the earth
            is so deep that the moon is forever trapped in a circular motion
            within it. This is the same through that apples fall into when they
            leave their tree towards the center of earth. If one could compress
            the earth into a sphere of a few millimeters, the resulting space
            through would be so large that not even light can escape it anymore:
            a black hole would be born, the most compact and fabled objects in
            the universe. Even more curious is perhaps the finding that the same
            dynamical nature also applies to the notion of time. The presence of
            heavy compact matter equally changes the flow of time, such that
            astronauts on the moon age slightly slower than their relatives on
            earth. This intertwined bending of space and time results in a
            cosmic dance that we call gravity, described in a unifying notion of
            spacetime in Einstein's theory of general relativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this knowledge is now already over 100 years old, we only
            recently managed to directly listen to the music that accompanies
            this spacetime dance: As a consequence of the dynamical nature of
            space and time, the universe is filled with a continuous sound of
            propagating spacetime waves send out by moving matter - like the
            ripples in a pond or soundwaves in the air. And amazingly, we can
            nowadays hear the loudest and most energetic events in the universe
            - collisions of two black holes that shake the spacetime structure
            in its very foundation - by measuring the changes in spacetime
            induced by the emitted gravitational waves.

            Even more captivating is perhaps the expectation that every binary
            black hole merger not only emits oscillatory ripples in the form of
            gravitational waves, but always also leaves behind a permanent
            imprint in spacetime. In the analogy used above, one could say that
            a spacetime dance of two black holes always includes two components:
            1) a high-frequency component that follows the periodic circles of
            the two approaching bodies. 2) a deep bass tone underlying the
            overall energy release, whose lowest frequencies permanently alter
            the fabric of spacetime. A phenomenon that is known as gravitational
            memory. These scars in the universe that remember past events are
            tightly linked to the symmetries that govern relativistic physics,
            spontaneously breaking them by picking out different non-zero
            configurations of the vacuum. Such a link to spacetime symmetries
            explains the universal nature of gravitational memory, an ubiquity
            that is not only present in gravity theories but is a general
            feature of so-called infrared - that is low-frequency - physics. To
            the point where gravitational memory might tell us about a
            fundamentally classical behavior of the infrared world as opposed to
            the quantum laws that governs the high-frequency scales. However,
            while the measurement of the high-frequency wiggles of gravitational
            waves is evolving into a daily business, the net change in spatial
            vacuum of the memory effect remains yet to be discovered. This is
            about to change in the next decade.

            The direct measurement of gravitational waves was made possible by a
            tremendous effort of advancing technology to a previously unimagined
            level to build the so far most sensitive scientific instruments. By
            measuring the interference patterns of two lasers traveling forth
            and back along two 4km arms, current gravitational wave detectors
            can measure changes in spatial distances equivalent to measuring the
            distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, to within the width
            of a human hair. Yet, the low-frequency sensitivity of these
            instruments on earth is fundamentally limited by the vibrations of
            earths crust. This is one of the main reasons why one of the biggest
            and most anticipated space missions of the European space agency and
            its US counterpart is to build a gravitational wave detector in
            space. An ambitions international collaboration between research
            institutions and industry partners is currently developing and
            building three satellites that will share their relative positions
            among each other through laser signals, building a triangle of
            several millions of kilometres embedded within the quietness of the
            cosmic void around earth to sense the whispers of the universe. This
            laser interferometer space antenna (LISA) will in particular be able
            to observe the slow dance of the merging of entire galaxies. And
            excitingly, our simulations of the LISA response to gravitational
            radiation show that this space-based observatory should also provide
            us with the first direct detection of gravitational wave memory.
            Such a measurement would open an observational window deep into
            radiation theory and the foundational concepts of spacetime
            symmetries and provide a new handle to test our knowledge of gravity
            and the dynamics of spacetime.

            The unified theory of the electric and magnetic fields, the second
            crucial long-range force that governs nature and our lives, has been
            established a long time ago, decades before the gravitational
            equivalent of general relativity was formulated. It comes therefore
            perhaps as a surprize that the recent advancements in understanding
            and describing gravitational memory has a fundamental impact that
            reaches all the way back to electromagnetism. Indeed, in an
            unprecedented reverse of history, only years after the first
            theoretical description of gravitational memory, an electromagnetic
            analogue was found: electromagnetic radiation too not only consists
            of the familiar electromagnetic waves that characterize the visible
            light, radio waves or X-rays, but can include signatures of a
            permanent offset in the radiation carrying transverse vector
            potential. Although the physical effect of electromagnetic memory is
            slightly less dramatic as in the gravitational case, corresponding
            to a net transverse velocity kick of test charges, it is equally
            radically connected to asymptotic symmetries and so-called soft
            theorems of the infrared physics. The most interesting aspect of
            electromagnetic memory is therefore the possibility of testing these
            foundational concepts in a fully controllable laboratory setting.
            Moreover, compared to the gravitational analogue, it is conceivable
            to obtain a true access to the net effect of the memory, without
            having to rely on an inference of its existence through the
            transition stage. And although the memory in electromagnetic
            radiation was not yet directly measured as well, recent work
            established a new mechanism to enhance the memory amplitude by
            several orders of magnitude. This finding could finally push the
            true zero-frequency signal of memory into the observational range.

            The dynamical nature of space and time has an additional truly
            fascinating implication. It entails the possibility that our whole
            universe is not a static container but evolves in time in its
            entirety. The study of this cosmic flow of time is called cosmology
            and is the area of physics that currently poses the biggest open
            questions to solve. The current standard model describes an ever
            expanding universe that once started in an extremely dense and hot
            state after a poorly understood event known as big bang. Amazingly,
            the afterglow of the big bang can however still be observed today,
            proving at least that the big bang has happened. This model of
            cosmology, know as ΛCDM, is based on the gravity theory of general
            relativity and despite the uncertainty about the big bang it is able
            to explain the transition from the big bang to the current state of
            the universe to a great accuracy. Yet, in recent years
            inconsistencies within the determination of key cosmological
            observables, such as its expansion rate H<sub>0</sub> and the
            clustering amplitude σ<sub>8</sub>, could indicate the first clear
            experimental sign for the need of an ingredient beyond Einstein’s
            theory of gravity.
